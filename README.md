# SpaceChess
 
A University C++ project for a games programming course. Space Chess is a simple game involving numerous quasi-chess pieces that can move in specific directions across a Euclidean plane while colliding and capturing each other. The imperative of this assessed project was to test C++ knowledge with heavy emphasis on diamond inheritance and other design decisions.
